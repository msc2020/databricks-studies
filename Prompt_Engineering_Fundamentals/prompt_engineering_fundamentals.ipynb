       "Treating a headache depends on the type and severity of the headache, as well as the individual's overall health. Here are some general tips to help alleviate headache symptoms:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help your body replenish fluids and electrolytes. Dehydration is a common cause of headaches.\n",
       "2. **Rest and relax**: Lie down in a quiet, dark room and try to relax. This can help reduce stress and promote relaxation.\n",
       "3. **Over-the-counter pain relievers**: Over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or aspirin can help relieve headache pain. However, always follow the recommended dosage and consult your doctor if you have any underlying medical conditions.\n",
       "4. **Apply heat or cold**: Applying a warm or cold compress to the forehead, neck, or shoulders can help relax muscles and improve blood flow.\n",
       "5. **Try relaxation techniques**: Techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help reduce stress and promote relaxation.\n",
       "6. **Avoid triggers**: Identify and avoid triggers that may be causing your headaches, such as certain foods, stress, or lack of sleep.\n",
       "7. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night to help regulate your body's natural pain-relieving chemicals.\n",
       "8. **Consider prescription medications**: If your headaches are severe or frequent, your doctor may prescribe prescription medications such as triptans or ergotamines.\n",
       "\n",
       "For specific types of headaches, such as:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Tension headaches**: Try relaxation techniques, over-the-counter pain relievers, and apply heat or cold to the affected area.\n",
       "* **Migraines**: Try prescription medications, rest in a quiet room, and avoid triggers such as bright lights or loud noises.\n",
       "* **Sinus headaches**: Try over-the-counter pain relievers, use a humidifier to add moisture to the air, and apply warm compresses to the face.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional if you experience:\n",
       "\n",
       "* Frequent or severe headaches\n",
       "* Headaches that worsen over time\n",
       "* Headaches accompanied by fever, confusion, or seizures\n",
       "* Headaches that interfere with daily activities\n",
