## Prompt_Engineering_Fundamentals

### Course description

>This course equips end users to get the most from their organization’s AI-powered assistants. Learners begin by understanding how the assistant works, its capabilities and limitations, and how to to create precise, business-relevant prompts by applying the COIE framework—Context, Outcome, Instruction, Example. They then progress to prompting techniques such as zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-ask, and meta-prompting to handle diverse content, reasoning, and workflow tasks. By the end, participants can structure complex requests, chain prompts effectively, and collaborate with their AI assistant as a reliable, reasoning partner that delivers accurate, actionable insights.
